(** Protocol for sending messages to the client: Sending something to
    the client involves sening first a command, then the message: (1st
    message)|Command

    Valid Commands are: 'Msg' -> Send a message next line

    'Quit' -> Invokes a command to quit with a quitting message

    'Alert' -> Sends an alert such as a "You are the host" message

    'Problem' -> Sends a set of 4 numbers the next line

    'Score' -> Sends the player'scurrent score

    'Time' -> Sends the player's current time

    "Num_in_lobby" -> Sends the number of people in the lobby currently *)
